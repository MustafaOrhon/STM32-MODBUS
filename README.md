# STM32 Modbus Library

This library originates from a Udemy course on STM32 development (see [Course Link](https://www.udemy.com/course/stm32-modbus-haberlesme-kursu)). It has been refined to provide safer and more reliable code. Key enhancements include:

- Comprehensive input validation to ensure robust operation.
- Conversion of `void` return types to `bool` where applicable, allowing clear success/failure checks.
- Improved error handling for edge cases and unexpected inputs.

## Features

- Supports Modbus RTU protocol on STM32 microcontrollers.
- Easily configurable for various STM32 families.
- Example projects included to demonstrate setup and usage.
- Modular design for integrating into existing STM32 CubeIDE or other IDE-based workflows.

## To-Do List

- **Detailed function explanations**: Add a thorough overview of each function, including parameters, return values, and usage examples.  
- **Full review of existing code**: Conduct a complete review of all library code to ensure consistency, clarity, and adherence to best practices.  
- _Additional enhancements as required._
